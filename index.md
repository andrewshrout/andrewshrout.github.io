[Real Estate ETL Pipeline](/mapstack_page)
<br>
This is a full extraction (scrapy), transformation (pandas, numpy), and loading pipeline (sqlalchemy) created for a proptech startup "mapstack". I extracted >4M data points monthly with various scrapers, cleaned them on AWS and loaded them into RDS. They were then pulled for a dashboard and mapping application to visualize for real estate investors.
